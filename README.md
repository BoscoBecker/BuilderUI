# üß© BuilderUI - (Design Patterns Applied)
### A JSON-based Form Designer for Windows with Modern Design Patterns

## üìå Overview

**BuilderUI** is a dynamic UI builder that empowers developers to design, preview, and manage Windows Forms entirely through structured JSON definitions. With an intuitive visual editor and real-time rendering, it simplifies the creation of complex forms without manual coding.

Key capabilities include:

- üîß **Visual Design Tools**: inspection and live form preview  
- üìÑ **JSON-Driven UI**: Define entire form structures and components declaratively via JSON  
- üöÄ **Multi-Platform Export**: Export your forms to Delphi, Lazarus, C# (.NET 9), and Java (Swing/AWT)  
- üß© **Component Customization**: Full control over properties, styles, and layout  
- üìê **Modern Architecture**: Clean structure using patterns like Factory, Strategy, SRP, and Adapter  

> Whether you're prototyping UIs or building full applications, BuilderUI offers flexibility, portability, and extensibility ‚Äî all powered by JSON.

## üìê Design Patterns & Project Architecture
BuilderUI applies several classic and modern design patterns to maintain a clean, scalable, and maintainable architecture. The system is modular and organized into well-defined layers, each with a specific responsibility, embracing SOLID principles.

üîß Applied Patterns

| Pattern                  | Description                                                                            | Examples / Files                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Factory Pattern**      | Encapsulates the instantiation of code generators per platform.                        | `Factory.ICodeGenerator`, `Factory.CodeGeneratorFactory`, `Factory.CodeGenerator.Delphi/CSharp/Lazarus`              |
| **Strategy Pattern**     | Decouples export logic into swappable algorithms per target platform.                  | `Strategy.IExport`, `Strategy.Export.Delphi`, `Strategy.Export.CSharp`, `Strategy.Export.Lazarus`                    |
| **Builder Pattern**      | Builds complex form structures from JSON definitions step by step.                     | `Builder.UIBuilderEngine`, `Core.IUIBuilder`                                                                         |
| **Adapter Pattern**      | Adapts third-party or incompatible APIs like TreeView and SynEdit into the system.     | `Adapter.TreeViewAdapter`, `Adapter.SynEditAdapter`                                                                  |
| **Service Layer**        | Isolates business logic into independent services.                                     | `Service.Zoom`, `Service.Export`, `Service.Json.Validation`, `Service.Component.Search`, `Service.StatusBar.Manager` |
| **Singleton (manual)**   | Provides a single shared instance for user configuration or global settings.           | `Builder.UI.UserPreferences`                                                                                         |
| **Decorator (implicit)** | Enhances or extends component behavior through wrapping or helpers.                    | Applied via class helpers and component managers                                                                     |
| **Observer (partial)**   | Used in form lifecycle handling (e.g., `OnClose`) and UI updates (e.g., zoom display). | `FormBuilderMain`, `Service.Forms.Manager`, `Service.StatusBar.Manager`                                              |
| **Facade (technical)**   | Central point of coordination between services, forms, adapters, and UI.               | `FormBuilderMain` acts as the entry point and orchestrator                                                           |

# ‚ú® AI Integration & Copilot Usage to create rich UI ‚ú®

## Using GitHub Copilot in VS Code for JSON Editing

You can leverage GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code to quickly generate and edit JSON files for BuilderUI:

1. **Open your project folder in VS Code.**
2. **Open or create a `.json` file** inside the `/src/Json` directory (e.g., `MyForm.json`).
3. **Use Copilot Chat or inline suggestions** to request or modify JSON structures.
   - For example, type a comment like:
     ```json
     // Generate a JSON for a login form with user, password fields and a login button based in BuilderUI pattern.
     ```
   - Or ask in Copilot Chat:
     ```
     Generate a product registration form with name, price, category (combobox), and save/cancel buttons based in BuilderUI pattern.
     ```
4. **Accept Copilot's suggestion** or edit as needed.
5. **Save the file.** Having your forms as `.json` files makes it much easier to edit, refactor, and reuse them with Copilot's help.

### Tips

- Saving your JSON files allows Copilot to provide better context and more accurate suggestions.
- You can easily modify, extend, or refactor your forms by editing the JSON and letting Copilot assist with repetitive or boilerplate structures.
- Use the provided JSON examples as templates for your own screens.

- Advanced JSON converter and formatter. Transforms data into a structured, precise JSON format. Also exports JSON in a CSV file.

**Open or create a `.json` file** inside the `/src/Json` directory (e.g., `MyForm.json`), send a context and later  the question


### Future - Integrated AI Chat

> The idea is to use an integrated chat to assist users in generating, editing, and refactoring JSON UI definitions. This chat-based AI can help automate repetitive tasks, provide instant suggestions, and accelerate the UI design process directly within your development environment. Coming soon, need help.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Delphi
3. Build and run the application
4. Use the JSON editor to create your form
5. Preview the results in real-time
6. Export to your desired platform

## Requirements

- Delphi IDE (Recent versions)
- Windows Operating System
- Skia4Delphi components
- Synedit
